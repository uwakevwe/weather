# weather
JavaScript weather script using the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch current weather data based on a city name input by the user:
This script creates a simple web page with an input field for the user to enter a city name and a button to fetch the weather data for that city. It then displays the temperature, weather description, humidity, and wind speed for the city entered. Make sure to replace 'YOUR_API_KEY' with your actual OpenWeatherMap API key.
